        <h3 class="about">MISSION</h3>
        <p class="about">Ruckus Music Publishing produces fine performance editions of music that is out of print, previously unpublished, or not widely available. Offering both fine bound, printed scores and digital downloadable scores, we aim to provide increased access to previously unavailable music in editions that are well-researched, carefully edited, and designed for practical performance use.</p>
        <p class="about">There is a wealth of fine music that is now out of print, has never been produced in a performerâ€™s edition, or has never been published at all. Of particular interest are works by women and other marginalized composers, much of which has never been made widely available and consequently, rarely appears in either in concert programs or pedagogical and educational curricula. Additionaly, music that is chronologically outside the canon, both early and contemporary, is too often overlooked or reserved for specialist study. </p>
        <p class="about">While many fine editions of early music do exist, a vast number of extant works have never been published in a modern edition and of those that have, a great many are only found in scholarly editions that are not widely available and are, in many ways, unsuitable to the practical needs of performers. </p>
        <p class="about">Ruckus also works with living composers to produce high-quality editions of their work and aid the wider distribution, performance, and public awareness of contemporary art music. </p><br>
